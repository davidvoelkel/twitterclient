## Context
This demo project is the result of my life-coding session "Mockist vs. Classicist TDD" I gave during the CLean Code Days 2015 and the Softwerkskammer Meetups in Berlin & Leipzig in January 2016. As it does not show the process, the value is limited. 

## Domain
The demo domain is a command line Twitter-Client, that shows all followers of a given twitter handle.
